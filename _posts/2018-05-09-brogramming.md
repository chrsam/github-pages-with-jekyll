# Brogramming 101

## Introduction
#### A female college undergrad just scored an internship at an up-an-coming startup in Silicon Valley. She's super excited to meet new people, explore the area, and escape the stereotypical college scene of frat bros and downing beers for a while. What surprises her is that a lot of her new coworkers still have remants of the "college mindset". They're cocky. They're pretentious. Other than code, all they're talking about is going to the bars and hitting on chicks. Why is this a thing? 

## What is it?
> "The practice of appearing to be desperately or intrusively seeking the appearance of being cool, technically adept, and/or productive, i.e. 'crushing it'." **(1)**

## Does it still exist? 
#### Answer: Yes, but at least people are becoming more aware of the issue
> "Left unchecked, that can create the sorts of toxic conditions for women we’ve been hearing so much about lately; at best, it’s terrible for business, since your team should reflect your customer base. So maintaining the status quo isn’t an option." **(2)**
